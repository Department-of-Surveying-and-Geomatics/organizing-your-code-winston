# Task1-Organizing-Your-Code-Functions

Task (Assignment) 1 Organizing Code using Functions

Create a function `plot_data()` which accepts a _file_ object as an input parameter and  returns a **scatterplot** of the data

- You can use the `get_file()` function which we created earlier to recall some of the processes. 
  
- You can find the `get_file()` function from the [return_statement.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/Department-of-Surveying-and-Geomatics/Programming-for-Geomatics-Applications/blob/main/functions_and_modules/return_statement.ipynb)

_Use the source code provided in the [task_one.py](task_one.py) as the starting point_
